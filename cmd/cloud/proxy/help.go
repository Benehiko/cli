If the request is not authenticated, the HTTP Authorization Header will be empty:

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost:3000

If the request was authenticated, a JSON Web Token will be sent in the HTTP Authorization Header containing the
Ory Session:

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost:3000
	Authorization: Bearer <the-json-web-token>

The JSON Web Token claims contain:

* The "sub" field which is set to the Ory Identity ID.
* The "session" field which contains the full Ory Session.

The JSON Web Token is signed using the ES256 algorithm. The public key can be found by fetching the /.ory/jwks.json path
when calling the proxy - for example http://127.0.0.1:4000/.ory/jwks.json

An example payload of the JSON Web Token is:

	{
	  "id": "821f5a53-a0b3-41fa-9c62-764560fa4406",
	  "active": true,
	  "expires_at": "2021-02-25T09:25:37.929792Z",
	  "authenticated_at": "2021-02-24T09:25:37.931774Z",
	  "issued_at": "2021-02-24T09:25:37.929813Z",
	  "identity": {
		"id": "18aafd3e-b00c-4b19-81c8-351e38705126",
		"schema_id": "default",
		"schema_url": "https://example.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/schemas/default",
		"traits": {
		  "email": "foo@bar",
		  // ... your other identity traits
		}
	  }
	}`
